			nor are we liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, special, incidental, punitive
			or other loss or damage resulting from or related to your access to the Mooky or
			our services.  Fares and pick up time displayed in the app are estimates only.  The
			estimates don&#39;t include any tolls or surcharges, if any. The actual price and time for
			the car to arrive may significantly vary based on the demand, traffic and other
			charges determined by the provider.
			USER PRIVACY STATEMENT
			Mooky collects information about you when you use our mobile applications,
			websites, and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) and
			through other interactions and communications you have with us. This Privacy
			Statement (“Statement&quot;) applies to persons anywhere in the world who use our
			Services to request transportation, delivery, or other on-demand services (“Users”).
			COLLECTION OF INFORMATION
			We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or
			modify your account, request on-demand services, contact customer support, or
			otherwise communicate with us. This information may include: name, email,
			phone number, postal address, profile picture, payment method, delivery notes, and
			other information you choose to provide.
			INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES
			When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following
			general categories:
			 Location Information: When you use the Services for transportation or
			delivery, we collect precise location data from the Mooky. If you permit the
			Mooky to access location services through the permission system used by
			your mobile operating system (“platform”), we may also collect the precise
			location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or
			background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP
			address.
			 Contacts Information: If you permit the Mooky to access the address book
			on your device through the platform, we may access and store names and
			contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions
			through our Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or
			at the time of consent or collection.
			 Transaction Information: We collect transaction details related to your use of
			our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the
			service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and other related
			transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promo code, we may
			associate your name with that person.
			 Usage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you
			and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and
			settings chosen.
			 Device Information: We may collect information about your mobile device,
			including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version,
			software and file names and versions, preferred language, unique device
			identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information,
			and mobile network information.
			 Log Information: When you interact with the Services, we collect server
			logs, which may include information such as device IP address, access dates
			and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system
			activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using
			before interacting with our Services.
			 Email Newsletter: When you submit your first name, last name, and email
			address to subscribe to the Mooky email newsletter, you are giving us
			permission to contact you via email to share news about Mooky and its
			partners.

			share with Mooky about your experience may be used by us for quality
			control and other purposes.
			USE OF INFORMATION
			We may use the information we collect about you to:
			 Provide, maintain, and improve our Services, including, for example, to
			provide services you request (and send related information), develop new
			features, provide customer support to Users, develop safety features,
			authenticate users, and send product updates and administrative messages;
			 Perform internal operations, including, for example, to prevent fraud and
			abuse of our Services; to troubleshoot software bugs and operational
			problems; to conduct data analysis, testing, and research; and to monitor
			and analyze usage and activity trends;
			 Send or facilitate communications (i) such as estimated times of arrival
			(ETAs), or (ii) in connection with your use of certain features, such as
			referrals, invites, split fare requests, or ETA sharing;
			 Send communications we think will be of interest to you, including
			information about products, services, promotions, news, and events of
			Mooky and other companies, where permissible and according to local
			applicable laws; and to process contest, sweepstake, or other promotion
			entries or fulfill any related awards; or
			 Personalize and improve the Services, including to provide or recommend
			features, content, social connections, referrals, and advertisements.
			We may transfer the information described in this Statement to, and process and
			store it in, the United States and other countries, some of which may have less
			protective data protection laws than the region in which you reside. Where this is
			the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your personal information in
			accordance with this Statement.
			SHARING OF INFORMATION
			We may share the information we collect about you as described in this Statement
			or as described at the time of collection or sharing, including as follows:
			THROUGH OUR SERVICES
			We may share your information:
			 With third parties to provide you a service you requested through a
			partnership or promotional offering made by a third party or us;
			 With the general public if you submit content in a public forum, such as blog
			comments, social media posts, or other features of our Services that are
			viewable by the general public; or
			 With third parties with whom you choose to let us share information, for
			example other apps or websites that integrate with our API or Services, or
			those with an API or Service with which we integrate.
			OTHER IMPORTANT SHARING
			We may share your information:
			 With vendors, consultants, marketing partners, and other service providers
			who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;
			 In response to a request for information by a competent authority if we
			believe disclosure is in accordance with, or is otherwise required by, any
			applicable law, regulation, or legal process;
			 With law enforcement officials, government authorities, or other third
			parties if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our policies, or to
			protect the rights, property, or safety of Mooky or others;
			 In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company
			assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a
			portion of our business by or into another company;
			 If we otherwise notify you and you consent to the sharing; or
			 In an aggregated and/or anonymized form which cannot reasonably be used
			to identify you.
			SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES
			The Services may integrate with social sharing features and other related tools
			which let you share actions you take on our Services with other apps, sites, or
			media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information
			with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the
			social sharing service. Please refer to the privacy policies of those social sharing
			services for more information about how they handle the data you provide to or
			share through them.
			ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS
			We may allow others to provide audience measurement and analytics services for
			us, to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet, and to track and
			report on the performance of those advertisements. These entities may use cookies,
			web beacons, SDKs, and other technologies to identify your device when you visit
			our site and use our Services, as well as when you visit other online sites and
			services.
			ACCOUNT INFORMATION
			You may correct your account information at any time by logging into your in-app
			account. Please note that in some cases we may retain certain information about
			you as required by law, or for legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted
			by law. For instance, if you have a standing credit or debt on your account, or if we
			believe you have committed fraud or violated our terms, we may seek to resolve
			the issue before terminating your access or deleting your information.
			ACCESS RIGHTS
			Mooky will comply with individual’s requests regarding access, correction, and/or
			deletion of the personal data it stores in accordance with applicable law.
			LOCATION INFORMATION
			We request permission for our app’s collection of precise location from your
			device per the permission system used by your mobile operating system. If you
			initially permit the collection of this information, you can later disable it by
			changing the location settings on your mobile device. However, this will limit your
			ability to use certain features of our Services. Additionally, disabling our app’s
			collection of precise location from your device will not limit our ability to collect
			other trip location information or our ability to derive approximate location from
			your IP address.
			CONTACT INFORMATION
			We may also seek permission for our app’s collection and syncing of contact
			information from your device per the permission system used by your mobile
			operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, iOS
			users can later disable it by changing the contacts settings on your mobile device.
			The Android platform does not provide such a setting.
			CHANGES TO THE STATEMENT
			We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let
			you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or App or through other
			communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify
			them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified
			Terms on the Site or App, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by
			the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then
			you can’t use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time
			we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and
			without notice, at our sole discretion.
			If you have any questions about the Statement or our practices, please feel free to
			contact us at info@Mookyapp.com.
			For the avoidance of doubt, Mooky does not provide transportation services, and
			Mooky is not a transportation carrier. It is up to the driver to offer transportation
			services, which may be requested by a passenger through the use of the services.
			Any decision by a passenger to accept transportation once such passenger is
			matched through the services with a driver is a decision made in such passenger’s
			sole discretion. Mooky offers information and a method to connect drivers and
			passengers with each other, but does not and does not intend to provide
			transportation services or act in any manner as a transportation carrier, and has no
			responsibility or liability for any transportation services voluntarily provided to
			any passenger by any driver using the services.
			ASSUMPTION OF RISK AND INDEMNITY
			You knowingly and freely assume all risk when using the services. You, on behalf
			of yourself, your personal representatives and your heirs, hereby voluntarily agree
			to release, waive, discharge, hold harmless, defend and indemnify Mooky and its
			officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents, successors and assigns, from
			and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs
			and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees
			arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the services
			or content or your user content (ii) ride contracts or your receipt of rides including,
			without limitation, for bodily injury, wrongful death, emotional distress, or other
			damages or harm, whether to you or to third parties, which may result from the
			provision of rides or participants therein, or (iii) violation of these terms, including,
			without limitation, claims for bodily injury, wrongful death, emotional distress,
			loss of services or other damages or harm, whether to you or to third parties, which
			may result from your use of the services.
			AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE
			You and Mooky agree that any dispute, claim or controversy between you and
			Mooky arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination,
			enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content
			(collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each
			party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii)
			to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
			prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a
			party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property
			rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”).
			The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state
			and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the
			parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You
			acknowledge and agree that you and Mooky are each waiving the right to a trial by
			jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class Passenger in any purported class action
			or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Mooky otherwise agree
			in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#39;s claims, and
			may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
			If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute
			Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding
			sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these
			Terms.
			Arbitration Rules
			The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association
			(“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
			Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”)
			then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA
			Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800- 778-
			7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement
			of this Section.
			Arbitration Process
			A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a
			written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA
			provides a form Demand for Arbitration
			at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form
			for California residents
			athttp://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will
			be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected
			by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to
			agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for
			Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA
			Rules.
			Arbitration Location and Procedure
			Unless you and Mooky otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the
			county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the
			arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and
			Mooky submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator
			determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to
			a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the
			arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information
			by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
			Arbitrator’s Decision
			The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA
			Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions
			upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may
			be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of
			damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section
			above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held
			liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
			claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
			claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an
			award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
			Mooky will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable
			law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
			Fees
			Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will
			be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does
			not exceed $75,000, Mooky will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that
			either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for
			Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by
			the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
			Changes
			Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services” section
			above, if Mooky changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first
			accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you
			may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to
			info@Mookyapp.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as
			indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Mooky’s email to you
			notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you
			will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Mooky in accordance with the
			provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted
			these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
			General Terms
			These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement
			between Mooky and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms
			supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or
			agreements between Mooky and you regarding the Services and Content. If for any
			reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid
			or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
			permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and
			effect.
			You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise,
			without Mooky’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer
			these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Mooky may freely
			assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these
			Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and
			permitted assigns.
			Any notices or other communications provided by Mooky under these Terms,
			including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: by Mooky
			(i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date
			of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
			Mooky’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
			considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will
			be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
			Mooky. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of
			any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other
			remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
			Contact Information
			If you have any questions about these Terms or the Services, please contact Mooky
